## Testing

### Front-end Testing

Front-end testing was conducted through multiple stages to ensure the application met our quality standards and functioned as intended across various environments.

#### Local Development Testing

Each feature was developed locally and thoroughly tested in a local development environment. This initial testing phase involved verifying the functionality of individual functions, components, and pages.

#### Public Development Testing

Once features were deemed stable in the local environment, they were pushed to a development branch. Here, testing was conducted using a public development database to simulate real-world usage and ensure compatibility with production settings. This phase also included testing on different devices and screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones, to ensure the application‚Äôs accessibility and responsiveness.

#### Production User Testing

Features were then tested in a staging environment that closely mirrored the production setup. This phase involved gathering feedback from real users to validate the usability and functionality of the application in a near-production environment.

#### Automated Testing with Cypress

Automated tests were run using Cypress to validate the overall functionality and performance of the application. Cypress testing included various scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage and identify any potential issues early in the development process.

Detailed results from user testing, including feedback and observations related to the login and sign-up workflows, are documented in a spreadsheet available in the GitHub repository. Additionally, a screenshot capturing further notes from the user testing is also provided in the same directory.

The results of the automated testing conducted with Cypress can be found in the Output.html file.

For additional context and visualization, screenshots of the testing processes and results are provided below, including commits and pushes to the dev branch:

## Trello Project Management (Part B)

Much like our Part A, we utilized Trello as our primary tool for delegating tasks, tracking progress, and setting due dates. Trello's intuitive interface allowed us to effectively organize our workflow and ensure that every team member was aware of their responsibilities. We made extensive use of Trello‚Äôs features, such as labels, checklists, and due dates, to streamline the planning process and keep everything on track. On each Saturday, we would review and update the Trello board with new tasks and priorities for the upcoming week, ensuring that everyone was aligned with the project's goals and deadlines.

To complement our use of Trello, we scheduled regular meetings on Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Mondays to discuss progress, address any blockers, and plan the next steps. These meetings provided a structured opportunity to collaborate, share updates, and ensure that the project was progressing smoothly. In addition to our scheduled meetings, we remained flexible and arranged ad hoc meetings throughout the week whenever we encountered questions, needed assistance, or had new ideas to discuss.

Our primary communication tool was Discord, where we created a dedicated server for the project. This server served as the central hub for all project related discussions, file sharing, and meeting coordination. Within the Discord server, we stored a Google Meet link, which we used for all our virtual meetings. This setup allowed us to quickly jump into meetings and collaborate effectively, regardless of where team members were located. The combination of Trello for task management and Discord for communication created a seamless workflow.

When reviewing the Trello board, you'll notice that each card is marked with the first initial of the team member responsible for that task, making it clear who is accountable for its completion. We've utilized color coded labels to convey essential information about each task.

- Priority levels are indicated by:
    - Red for high priority,
    - Orange for medium priority, and
    - Dark Green for low priority.
  
- Task type is identified by:
    - Light Green for front-end work, and
    - Dark Blue for back-end tasks.

- Feature classification is denoted by:
    - Purple for core functionality, and
    - Blue for optional features.

This system allowed us to easily manage and prioritize tasks, ensuring that everyone was on the same page and that the most critical work received the attention it needed.
