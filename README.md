## Testing

### Front-end Testing

Front-end testing was conducted through multiple stages to ensure the application met our quality standards and functioned as intended across various environments.

#### Local Development Testing

Each feature was developed locally and thoroughly tested in a local development environment. This initial testing phase involved verifying the functionality of individual functions, components, and pages.

#### Public Development Testing

Once features were deemed stable in the local environment, they were pushed to a development branch. Here, testing was conducted using a public development database to simulate real-world usage and ensure compatibility with production settings. This phase also included testing on different devices and screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones, to ensure the application’s accessibility and responsiveness.

#### Production User Testing

Features were then tested in a staging environment that closely mirrored the production setup. This phase involved gathering feedback from real users to validate the usability and functionality of the application in a near-production environment.

#### Automated Testing with Cypress

Automated tests were run using Cypress to validate the overall functionality and performance of the application. Cypress testing included various scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage and identify any potential issues early in the development process.

Detailed results from user testing, including feedback and observations related to the login and sign-up workflows, are documented in a spreadsheet available in the GitHub repository. Additionally, a screenshot capturing further notes from the user testing is also provided in the same directory.

The results of the automated testing conducted with Cypress can be found in the Output.html file.

For additional context and visualization, screenshots of the testing processes and results are provided below, including commits and pushes to the dev branch:

### Back-end Testing

## Overview

Backend testing was carried out meticulously to ensure the robustness, security, and accuracy of API endpoints as outlined in the project specifications. The testing process was comprehensive, covering all aspects from data validation to performance under load, and ensuring secure access through proper authentication mechanisms. The testing was divided into several phases, including local, staging, and production environments, each designed to thoroughly validate each feature under various conditions and scenarios, from typical use cases to potential edge cases. This approach ensured that the API was not only functional but also resilient and scalable.

### Local Development Testing

Initial testing of the backend API routes was conducted in a local environment using Postman. Each route was subjected to detailed scrutiny, ensuring correct HTTP status codes, response bodies, and JWT token authentication where applicable. The testing process involved various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and error responses. Special attention was given to edge cases, such as handling of malformed requests, rate limiting, and ensuring proper data validation rules were enforced. Logging and error reporting mechanisms were also verified to ensure that they provided sufficient information for debugging and monitoring. This phase focused on verifying the basic functionality and ensuring that the API could handle different input cases reliably, preparing it for more rigorous testing in later stages.

### Production Environment Testing

Final testing was conducted in the production environment using the live API. This testing phase was critical to validate that all endpoints functioned as expected in a real-world setting with actual user data. In addition to functional testing, this phase included performance and stress testing to evaluate the API's behavior under heavy load, ensuring that it could scale appropriately without degradation of service. Security testing was also a key focus, with JWT authentication being rigorously tested for vulnerabilities such as token expiration, revocation handling, and protection against unauthorized access. The overall API performance, including response times, was measured to ensure it met the required standards. Monitoring tools were employed to track the API's health and performance metrics, ensuring that any issues could be quickly identified and addressed.

### Summary

The backend testing process was comprehensive and covered all possible scenarios, from normal operation to potential edge cases. Each endpoint was tested rigorously across different environments, ensuring not only correct functionality but also security, scalability, and resilience. Automated tests were implemented to facilitate continuous integration and catch regressions early in the development process. All tests passed successfully, and the API was deemed ready for production deployment. The detailed logs and results from the testing phases are stored in the project repository for further reference, providing a clear audit trail and insights for future development and maintenance.

## Trello Project Management (Part B)

Much like our Part A, we utilized Trello as our primary tool for delegating tasks, tracking progress, and setting due dates. Trello's intuitive interface allowed us to effectively organize our workflow and ensure that every team member was aware of their responsibilities. We made extensive use of Trello’s features, such as labels, checklists, and due dates, to streamline the planning process and keep everything on track. On each Saturday, we would review and update the Trello board with new tasks and priorities for the upcoming week, ensuring that everyone was aligned with the project's goals and deadlines.

We decided to split the project into back-end and front-end development, and delegated our tasks and deliverables according to each members strengths and weaknesses. As a result, Rahal was given the front-end to work on as he had more experience working with frameworks such as Material UI which would help him get the website up and running faster, and because he created the wireframes and so would be most comfortable designing the pages. Suraj and Talie were then given back-end to work on, as they were much more comfortable and familiar with MongoDB and working with databases. This led us to complete our tasks and goals in a timely fashion which may not have been possible if we did not take these factors into account.

To complement our use of Trello, we scheduled regular meetings on Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Mondays to discuss progress, address any blockers, and plan the next steps. These meetings provided a structured opportunity to collaborate, share updates, and ensure that the project was progressing smoothly. In addition to our scheduled meetings, we remained flexible and arranged ad hoc meetings throughout the week whenever we encountered questions, needed assistance, or had new ideas to discuss.

Our primary communication tool was Discord, where we created a dedicated server for the project. This server served as the central hub for all project related discussions, file sharing, and meeting coordination. Within the Discord server, we stored a Google Meet link, which we used for all our virtual meetings. This setup allowed us to quickly jump into meetings and collaborate effectively, regardless of where team members were located. The combination of Trello for task management and Discord for communication created a seamless workflow.

When reviewing the Trello board, you'll notice that each card is marked with the first initial of the team member responsible for that task, making it clear who is accountable for its completion. We've utilized color coded labels to convey essential information about each task.

- Priority levels are indicated by:
  - Red for high priority,
  - Orange for medium priority, and
  - Dark Green for low priority.
  
- Task type is identified by:
  - Light Green for front-end work, and
  - Dark Blue for back-end tasks.

- Feature classification is denoted by:
  - Purple for core functionality, and
  - Blue for optional features.

This system allowed us to easily manage and prioritize tasks, ensuring that everyone was on the same page and that the most critical work received the attention it needed.
